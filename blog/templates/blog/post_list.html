            <p>Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ jang-goh) is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.

When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.

Luckily for you other people long ago noticed that web developers face similar problems when building a new site, so they teamed up and created frameworks (Django is one of them) that give you ready-made components you can use.

Frameworks exist to save you from having to reinvent the wheel and help alleviate some of the overhead when you’re building a new site.</p>

To start playing with Python, we need to open up a command line on your computer. You should already know how to do that -- you learned it in the Intro to Command Line chapter.

Once you're ready, follow the instructions below.

We want to open up a Python console, so type in python on Windows or python3 on Mac OS/Linux and hit enter.

$ python3
Python 3.4.3 (...)
